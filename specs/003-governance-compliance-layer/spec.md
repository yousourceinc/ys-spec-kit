# Feature Specification: Governance Layer with Automated Compliance Checking and Waiver Process

**Feature Branch**: `003-governance-compliance-layer`  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Introduce a governance layer by implementing an automated compliance checking system and a formal waiver process. Ensure code is generated based on guides and verified against them, with a clear, auditable trail for exceptions."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Engineer Creates and Records Compliance Waivers (Priority: P1)

An engineer is working on a feature that requires deviating from an established implementation guide. Instead of simply breaking the rule, they need a way to formally document the deviation with a clear reason and timestamp. They use the `/waive-requirement` command to record this deviation in a version-controlled file, creating an auditable trail for why the exception was necessary.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the foundational capability that enables governance. Without the ability to record exceptions formally, the entire compliance system lacks legitimacy and auditability. This is critical for regulated environments and team accountability.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing the `/waive-requirement` command with a reason and verifying that the waiver is appended to `.specify/waivers.md` with a timestamp, creating an immutable audit log that is version-controlled.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an engineer is working on a feature that deviates from a guide, **When** they execute `/waive-requirement "Disabling MFA for internal service accounts as per ticket #1234"`, **Then** the waivers.md file is created (if not exists) and the waiver with timestamp is appended in a structured format
2. **Given** multiple waivers have been recorded, **When** viewing the waivers.md file, **Then** each waiver includes the reason, timestamp, and is presented in chronological order
3. **Given** a waiver has been recorded, **When** checking git history, **Then** the waiver appears as a committed change in the version control system
4. **Given** an engineer executes `/waive-requirement` with an empty or missing reason, **When** the command processes, **Then** the system provides clear guidance on the required reason format

### User Story 2 - Developer Checks Code Compliance Against Guides (Priority: P1)

A developer wants to verify that their implemented code follows the implementation guides that were supposed to guide the development. They execute `/check-compliance` which analyzes the codebase against machine-readable rules extracted from the relevant implementation guides (identified from plan.md and tasks.md), and generates a comprehensive report showing which rules passed, failed, or were waived.

**Why this priority**: P1 - This is the core compliance enforcement capability. Without automated checking, guides become recommendations rather than standards. This directly enables the transformation from "guidelines" to "guardrails."

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by executing `/check-compliance` after implementing a feature with known compliance points and verifying that the command correctly identifies guide violations and generates a compliance report with accurate pass/fail/waived status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a project with plan.md and tasks.md referencing specific implementation guides, **When** `/check-compliance` is executed, **Then** the system identifies which guides are relevant from plan.md/tasks.md references
2. **Given** relevant guides contain machine-readable rules (file_exists, dependency_present, text_includes), **When** the compliance check runs, **Then** the system scans the codebase and evaluates each rule against source code
3. **Given** some rules fail compliance checks and no corresponding waivers exist, **When** compliance report is generated, **Then** failed rules appear with status "Failed" and details about what was expected vs. what was found
4. **Given** a failed rule has a corresponding waiver in .specify/waivers.md, **When** compliance report is generated, **Then** that rule appears with status "Waived" instead of "Failed" with the waiver reason referenced
5. **Given** the compliance check completes, **When** the report is generated, **Then** compliance-report.md is created with sections for Passed, Failed, and Waived rules, including pass/fail/waive counts and detailed rule information

### User Story 3 - Team Lead Reviews Governance Audit Trail (Priority: P2)

A tech lead needs to understand what compliance exceptions have been granted across the project. They review the `.specify/waivers.md` file to see all recorded waivers with reasons and timestamps, and cross-reference these against compliance reports to ensure governance practices are being followed consistently.

**Why this priority**: P2 - This enables accountability and governance oversight. Team leads can see the historical record of exceptions and assess whether waiver patterns indicate training gaps or legitimate technical constraints.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by reviewing the waivers.md file structure and format to confirm it contains complete audit trail information (reason, timestamp, clear entries) that enables governance review.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple waivers have been recorded over time, **When** viewing waivers.md, **Then** all waivers are visible in chronological order with clear separation between entries
2. **Given** a waiver has been recorded, **When** a team lead reviews waivers.md, **Then** they can understand the reason for the deviation without needing additional context
3. **Given** compliance-report.md references waivers, **When** cross-referencing with waivers.md, **Then** the waivers and compliance report provide consistent information about exceptions

### User Story 4 - Enhancement: Guide Authors Embed Compliance Rules (Priority: P3)

A guide author working on an implementation guide wants to define machine-readable compliance rules directly in their guide file. They add a structured rules section (YAML frontmatter or similar) that defines what checks should be performed (file_exists, dependency_present, text_includes). When `/check-compliance` runs, these rules are automatically discovered and evaluated.

**Why this priority**: P3 - This enables scale and reduces manual rule configuration. While the core compliance system works with manually configured rules, embedding rules directly in guides makes the system more maintainable and ensures guides and compliance rules stay synchronized.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by adding machine-readable rules to a guide file and verifying that `/check-compliance` discovers and evaluates those rules correctly.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an implementation guide contains a structured rules section, **When** the compliance checker parses the guide, **Then** it correctly extracts the defined rules
2. **Given** rules are defined with correct syntax (file_exists, dependency_present, text_includes), **When** compliance check runs, **Then** each rule is evaluated against the codebase
3. **Given** rules are defined with incomplete or incorrect syntax, **When** compliance check runs, **Then** the system provides clear error messages about rule parsing failures

### Edge Cases

- What happens when `.specify/waivers.md` doesn't exist? (First waiver should create it)
- What happens when a compliance check is run but no guides are referenced in plan.md/tasks.md? (Report should clearly indicate no guides to check)
- What happens when a guide contains invalid or unparseable rule syntax? (System should log the error and skip that rule, continuing with valid rules)
- What happens when `.specify/waivers.md` contains corrupted or malformed entries? (System should attempt to parse what it can and report parsing errors)
- What happens when a waiver exists but the corresponding compliance rule no longer exists in the guides? (Waiver remains valid and may not be referenced in new reports)
- What happens when multiple rules fail but no waivers exist? (All appear as "Failed" with clear failure reasons)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide `/waive-requirement` command that accepts a plain-text reason as argument
- **FR-002**: System MUST append waiver records to `.specify/waivers.md` file in a structured, parseable format including: reason, timestamp, and unique identifier
- **FR-003**: System MUST ensure `.specify/waivers.md` is version-controlled (committed to git) creating an immutable audit log
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide `/check-compliance` command that scans the codebase for compliance with implementation guides
- **FR-005**: System MUST parse plan.md and tasks.md to identify which implementation guides are referenced and therefore should be checked
- **FR-006**: System MUST support machine-readable rules in implementation guides with at least these types: `file_exists`, `dependency_present`, `text_includes`
- **FR-007**: System MUST read and apply waivers from `.specify/waivers.md` when checking compliance, marking waived rules as "Waived" instead of "Failed"
- **FR-008**: System MUST generate `compliance-report.md` with sections for Passed, Failed, and Waived rules, including counts and detailed information
- **FR-009**: System MUST match waived requirements to failed rules using clear linking mechanism (rule identifier to waiver reason)
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide clear error messages when rule evaluation fails or rules contain syntax errors
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle missing or non-existent files referenced in compliance checks gracefully (e.g., file_exists check on deleted file)
- **FR-012**: System MUST support embedding rules directly in implementation guides [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: YAML frontmatter, JSON frontmatter, or custom marker syntax?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST log all compliance check operations for auditability

### Key Entities

- **Waiver**: A recorded exception to a compliance requirement, containing: unique identifier, reason, timestamp, optionally linked rule identifier(s)
- **Compliance Rule**: A machine-readable requirement in an implementation guide, containing: rule type (file_exists, dependency_present, text_includes), target/path specification, expected condition
- **Compliance Report**: Generated document summarizing compliance status, containing: pass count, fail count, waive count, detailed rule results with status and reason
- **Implementation Guide**: Existing document that may be augmented with machine-readable rules; defines standards and best practices for a specific domain or practice area
- **Plan/Tasks Reference**: Specification documents that reference which guides apply to a feature, used to determine relevant compliance rules

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Engineers can record a compliance waiver with reason and timestamp in under 10 seconds using `/waive-requirement`
- **SC-002**: A compliance check completes analysis of typical project codebase in under 30 seconds
- **SC-003**: All recorded waivers (100%) appear in version control history as committed changes
- **SC-004**: Compliance report accurately identifies 95%+ of actual compliance violations when tested against known guide requirements
- **SC-005**: When waivers exist for failed rules, 100% of those rules are correctly marked as "Waived" (not "Failed") in compliance reports
- **SC-006**: Team leads can understand the governance audit trail without additional context (waivers.md contains sufficient information for independent review)
- **SC-007**: Compliance rules embedded in implementation guides are correctly parsed and evaluated in 100% of cases with valid syntax
- **SC-008**: System provides clear, actionable error messages for 100% of rule parsing failures or missing file references

### Qualitative Outcomes

- **QO-001**: Development teams gain confidence that code quality standards are actively enforced, not just recommended
- **QO-002**: Governance processes transform from reactive (manual audits) to proactive (automated checking)
- **QO-003**: Exception handling becomes transparent and auditable, reducing governance friction
- **QO-004**: The tool evolves from "guide" to "guardrail" enabling scale in compliance management

## Assumptions

- Implementation guides that exist will follow a consistent structure that allows rule extraction
- The project maintains plan.md and tasks.md files that reference relevant implementation guides
- Waiver reasons will be brief (single line) for simplicity in initial version
- Compliance rules use simple syntax that can be parsed without requiring complex DSL
- Teams have access to file system and source code for compliance checking
- Git repository is available for version control of waivers.md

## Out of Scope

- GUI/Web interface for waiver management (CLI only in initial version)
- Real-time compliance monitoring or continuous checking
- Automated remediation of compliance violations
- Integration with external compliance/audit systems
- Machine-learning based rule generation
- Custom/advanced rule types beyond file_exists, dependency_present, text_includes
- Role-based access control for waivers (anyone can create, anyone can see - simple audit trail)
