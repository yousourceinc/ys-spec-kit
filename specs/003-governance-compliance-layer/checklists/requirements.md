# Specification Quality Checklist: Governance Layer with Automated Compliance Checking and Waiver Process

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-21  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain (1 clarification marked, but manageable)
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Clarifications Resolved

### FR-012 Clarification: Rule Embedding Format

**Topic**: Rule embedding syntax in implementation guides

**Context**: "System MUST support embedding rules directly in implementation guides [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: YAML frontmatter, JSON frontmatter, or custom marker syntax?]"

**Selection Made**: YAML frontmatter

**Rationale**: YAML frontmatter is:
- Industry standard for documentation tools (Jekyll, Hugo, Markdown processors)
- Human-readable and easy to author
- Well-established parsing libraries available
- Familiar to most developers
- Can coexist with regular guide markdown

**Updated Requirement**: System MUST support embedding compliance rules in implementation guides using YAML frontmatter block at the top of the guide file, containing rule definitions with type, target, and expected conditions.

## Notes

- Specification successfully defines governance layer with clear user stories prioritized by criticality
- P1 stories (waiver creation and compliance checking) establish the core governance framework
- P2 story (audit trail review) enables accountability and governance oversight
- P3 enhancement (embedded rules) defers complexity while maintaining future extensibility
- One clarification (rule embedding format) resolved by selecting YAML frontmatter standard
- All requirements are testable and success criteria are measurable and user-focused
- Specification is production-ready for planning phase
