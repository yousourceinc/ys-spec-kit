# Tasks: Governance Layer with Automated Compliance Checking and Waiver Process

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/003-governance-compliance-layer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md ‚úÖ, spec.md ‚úÖ, research.md ‚úÖ, data-model.md ‚úÖ, contracts/ ‚úÖ

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phases 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1) can start after Foundational
  - User Story 2 (P1) can start after Foundational (requires User Story 1 complete for waiver integration)
  - User Story 3 (P2) can start after User Stories 1 & 2 complete (enhances existing features)
  - User Story 4 (P3) can start after Foundational (independent of other stories, enhances rule authoring)
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational - No dependencies on other stories (waiver creation is standalone)
- **User Story 2 (P1)**: Depends on User Story 1 (needs waiver reading for waived rule status)
- **User Story 3 (P2)**: Depends on User Stories 1 & 2 (enhances waiver review and reporting)
- **User Story 4 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational - Independent (focuses on guide authoring, not runtime features)

### Within Each User Story

**User Story 1 (Waivers)**:
1. WaiverManager class implementation (T019-T023)
2. CLI command integration (T024-T027)
3. Unit tests (T028)
4. Integration tests (T029-T034)
5. Documentation (T035)

**User Story 2 (Compliance Checking)**:
1. Discovery and evaluation components (T036-T045) - can run in parallel
2. Report generation (T046-T054)
3. CLI command integration (T055-T060)
4. Unit tests (T061-T063) - can run in parallel

2. Integration tests (T085-T088)
3. Documentation (T089)

**User Story 4 (Rule Authoring)**:

### Parallel Opportunities

**Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- T003 (PyYAML dependency)
- T004 (Test directories)

**Phase 2 (Foundational)**: 
- Rule class implementations (T006, T007, T008) can run in parallel
- Rule unit tests (T012, T013, T014) can run in parallel
- Test fixtures (T017, T018) can run in parallel

**Phase 3 (User Story 1)**: All tasks sequential (small, focused implementation)

**Phase 4 (User Story 2)**:
- Discovery, evaluation, report components can be developed in parallel (T036-T054)
- Unit tests (T061, T062, T063) can run in parallel

**Phase 7 (Polish)**: Most documentation and cleanup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel

## Parallel Example: Foundational Phase

```bash
# Launch rule implementations in parallel:
Developer A: "Implement FileExistsRule in src/specify_cli/governance/rules/file_rules.py"
Developer B: "Implement DependencyPresentRule in src/specify_cli/governance/rules/dependency_rules.py"
Developer C: "Implement TextIncludesRule in src/specify_cli/governance/rules/text_rules.py"

# Launch unit tests in parallel (after implementations complete):
Developer A: "Create unit tests for FileExistsRule in tests/unit/governance/test_file_rules.py"
Developer B: "Create unit tests for DependencyPresentRule in tests/unit/governance/test_dependency_rules.py"
Developer C: "Create unit tests for TextIncludesRule in tests/unit/governance/test_text_rules.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Stories 1 & 2 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (Waiver creation) ‚Üí Test independently
4. Complete Phase 4: User Story 2 (Compliance checking) ‚Üí Test independently
5. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test waiver + compliance workflow end-to-end
6. Deploy/demo v0.4.1-rc1

### Incremental Delivery

1. Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready (rule engine works)
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP waiver feature (can record exceptions)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí MVP compliance checking (can verify code)
4. **RELEASE v0.4.1**: Core governance features complete
5. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Enhance audit trail review
6. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Enhance guide authoring experience
7. **RELEASE v0.4.2**: Enhanced governance with better UX

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together (critical path)
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1 (Waivers)
   - Developer B: User Story 4 (Rule authoring - independent)
3. After User Story 1 completes:
   - Developer A: User Story 2 (Compliance - needs waivers)
   - Developer B: Continues User Story 4
4. After User Stories 1 & 2 complete:
   - Developer A or B: User Story 3 (Audit trail enhancements)
5. Polish phase: All developers collaborate

## Performance Targets

From spec.md Success Criteria:

- **SC-001**: Waiver recording: <10 seconds ‚Üí Target tasks: T019-T027
- **SC-002**: Compliance check: <30 seconds ‚Üí Target tasks: T036-T060 (validate in T123)
- **File operations**: Use pathlib for cross-platform compatibility

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Foundation (Phase 2) MUST complete before any user story work
- User Story 2 requires User Story 1 complete (waiver integration)
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at each checkpoint to validate story independently
- Performance validation at T123: ensure <30 second compliance check
- Edge case testing at T124: validate all spec.md edge cases
