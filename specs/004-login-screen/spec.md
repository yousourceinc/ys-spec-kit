# Feature Specification: Login Screen

**Feature Branch**: `004-login-screen`  
**Created**: October 22, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "a login screen"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Existing User Login (Priority: P1)

A registered user needs to access their account by entering their credentials on the login screen.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - without the ability for existing users to log in, the login screen serves no purpose. This is the fundamental MVP requirement.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by creating a test account, navigating to the login screen, entering valid credentials, and verifying successful authentication and redirect to the application.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a registered user on the login screen, **When** they enter valid email and password and click login, **Then** they are authenticated and redirected to the main application
2. **Given** a registered user on the login screen, **When** they enter incorrect credentials, **Then** they see an error message indicating invalid credentials without revealing which field is wrong
3. **Given** a user has entered their credentials, **When** they press Enter key in the password field, **Then** the login form is submitted

### User Story 2 - Password Recovery (Priority: P2)

A user who has forgotten their password needs a way to recover access to their account.

**Why this priority**: Password recovery is essential for user retention and reducing support burden, but users can still log in if they remember their credentials.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by clicking "Forgot Password" link, entering an email address, and verifying the password reset flow is initiated without requiring a successful login.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the login screen, **When** they click "Forgot Password" link, **Then** they are taken to a password recovery screen
2. **Given** a user on the password recovery screen, **When** they enter their registered email, **Then** they receive password reset instructions
3. **Given** a user on the password recovery screen, **When** they enter an unregistered email, **Then** they see a generic success message (for security, don't reveal if email exists)

### User Story 3 - Account Creation Path (Priority: P3)

A new user who doesn't have an account needs a clear path to create one.

**Why this priority**: While important for user acquisition, this is primarily navigation to account creation functionality rather than core login functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying the presence and functionality of a "Sign Up" or "Create Account" link that navigates to the registration flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new user on the login screen, **When** they click "Create Account" link, **Then** they are redirected to the account registration screen
2. **Given** a user unsure if they have an account, **When** they view the login screen, **Then** they can clearly see both login and sign-up options

---

### User Story 4 - Remember Me Functionality (Priority: P4)

A user accessing from a personal device wants to stay logged in for future sessions without re-entering credentials.

**Why this priority**: This is a convenience feature that enhances user experience but is not essential for basic login functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by logging in with "Remember Me" checked, closing the browser, reopening it, and verifying the user remains authenticated.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user on the login screen, **When** they check "Remember Me" and log in successfully, **Then** they remain authenticated in future sessions
2. **Given** a user on the login screen, **When** they do not check "Remember Me" and log in, **Then** their session expires when they close the browser

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts?
- How does the system handle login attempts while the user is already logged in on another device?
- What happens if the user tries to log in with an email address that contains special characters?
- How does the system respond when authentication service is unavailable?
- What happens when a user leaves the login screen idle for an extended period?
- How does the system handle extremely long email addresses or passwords?
- What happens when a user rapidly submits the login form multiple times?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-002**: System MUST validate that email field contains a properly formatted email address before submission
- **FR-003**: System MUST mask password input characters for security
- **FR-004**: System MUST authenticate users against stored credentials
- **FR-005**: System MUST display clear error messages for authentication failures without revealing whether email or password was incorrect
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a "Forgot Password" link to initiate password recovery
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide a "Create Account" or "Sign Up" link for new users
- **FR-008**: System MUST include an optional "Remember Me" checkbox to persist user sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST prevent form submission with empty required fields
- **FR-010**: System MUST lock accounts after [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: number of failed attempts not specified - typically 3-5 attempts?] consecutive failed login attempts
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide visual feedback during authentication processing (e.g., loading indicator)
- **FR-012**: System MUST redirect successfully authenticated users to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: destination after login not specified - dashboard, home page, or last visited page?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support keyboard navigation and form submission via Enter key
- **FR-014**: System MUST display appropriate error messages for network or system failures
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement rate limiting to prevent brute force attacks

### Key Entities

- **User Account**: Represents an authenticated user with stored credentials (email, password hash) and account status (active, locked, disabled)
- **Login Session**: Represents an authenticated user's active session with creation time, expiration time, and persistence preferences
- **Authentication Attempt**: Represents a login attempt with timestamp, result (success/failure), and associated user account for security monitoring
