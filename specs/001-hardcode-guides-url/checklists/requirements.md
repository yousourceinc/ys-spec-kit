# Specification Quality Checklist: Hardcode Implementation Guides Repository URL

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-20  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Specification Status**: âœ… COMPLETE AND READY

All checklist items pass validation:

1. **Content Quality**: Specification is written in business language focused on user needs. No Python, git commands, or technical implementation details in the requirements.

2. **No Clarifications Needed**: All requirements are clear and unambiguous. No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.

3. **Measurable Success Criteria**: All success criteria (SC-001 through SC-006) are measurable with specific percentages, time limits, or verifiable outcomes.

4. **Technology-Agnostic**: Success criteria describe user outcomes without mentioning Python, git submodules, or specific technical implementations.

5. **Complete Acceptance Scenarios**: Each user story has detailed Given/When/Then scenarios that can be independently tested.

6. **Edge Cases Documented**: Six edge cases identified covering directory conflicts, network issues, git repository requirements, empty repositories, interruptions, and invalid URLs.

7. **Clear Scope**: Out of scope section explicitly defines what is NOT included (multiple repos, GUI, version pinning, etc.).

8. **Dependencies Listed**: Git, network access, GitHub SSH access, and existing guides repository clearly documented.

**Ready for Next Phase**: This specification is ready for `/plan` command to create technical implementation plan.

**Note**: This specification was created retroactively to document the already-implemented feature. The implementation in `src/specify_cli/__init__.py` already exists and matches this specification.
