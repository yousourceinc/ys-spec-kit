# Specification Quality Checklist: Division-Aware Workflow

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 21, 2025  
**Feature**: [specs/002-division-aware-workflow/spec.md](spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Summary

### Content Quality Assessment
✅ **PASS** - The specification focuses on "what" the system must do (divide projects by type, prioritize guides, provide division-aware AI guidance) without specifying "how" (no mentions of specific languages, frameworks, APIs, or databases). Clear focus on user value: developers get context-specific guidance aligned with their team's division.

### Requirement Completeness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - 12 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-012) clearly specify capabilities without ambiguity. 10 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-010) are measurable and technology-agnostic. All acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with specific, testable outcomes. Edge cases cover missing files, corruption, division changes, invalid inputs, and requests for non-existent divisions. Scope is bounded to the division-aware workflow feature without scope creep.

### Feature Readiness Assessment
✅ **PASS** - All 12 functional requirements have corresponding acceptance scenarios or success criteria that enable testing. Four user stories (US1-US4) cover primary flows: initialization, AI guidance, guide discovery, and prompt updates. User Story 1 (initialization) and US2 (AI guidance) are marked P1 (critical); US3 and US4 are P2 (important but secondary). Each user story is independently testable and delivers measurable value.

### Implementation Clarity Assessment
✅ **PASS** - Specification avoids implementation details. References to `.specify/project.json` are describing data structure (what gets stored), not how to implement it. References to context scripts and AI templates describe roles and responsibilities without specifying implementation approach. Division structure (`context/references/<DIVISION>/`) is organizational pattern, not implementation.

## Notes

- **Division Predefinition**: The specification assumes divisions (SE, DS, Platform) are predefined. If dynamic division creation is desired, this would be scope creep and should be addressed in a separate feature.
- **Guide Organization**: The specification assumes guides can be organized by division subdirectories. Implementation will need to verify this is feasible in the current guides repository structure.
- **AI Agent Capabilities**: Success depends on AI agents' ability to read and interpret division-specific instructions. This is not an implementation detail but a reasonable assumption given the AI agent framework.
- **Backward Compatibility**: The assumption section notes that existing projects without `.specify/project.json` will default to SE. This should be validated during implementation planning.

## Readiness for Next Phase

✅ **READY** - Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

**Recommendation**: Proceed directly to `/speckit.plan` for detailed task breakdown, as specification is clear and requires no further clarification.
