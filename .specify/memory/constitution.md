# YS Spec Kit Constitution


## Core Principles


### I. Specification-First
Every feature and change begins with a written specification. Specifications MUST be explicit, testable, and reviewed before implementation. No code is written until the spec is approved.

### II. Test-Driven Implementation
All code MUST be developed using TDD. Tests are written and approved before implementation. Red-Green-Refactor is strictly enforced. No feature is complete without passing tests.

### III. CLI and Automation Focus
All libraries and features MUST expose a CLI interface. Input/output is text-based (stdin/stdout), supporting both human-readable and JSON formats. Automation and scripting are first-class citizens.

### IV. Integration and Contract Testing
Integration tests are required for all new contracts, inter-service communication, and shared schemas. Contract changes MUST be accompanied by updated tests and migration plans.


### V. Observability and Simplicity
All systems MUST provide structured logging and clear error reporting. Simplicity is prioritized: avoid over-engineering, follow YAGNI, and document rationale for complexity.

### VI. Developer-Centric Experience
All interfaces, particularly the CLI, MUST be designed for clarity and ease of use. Commands should be intuitive, documentation (via --help flags and READMEs) must be comprehensive, and error messages must be user-friendly and actionable. The primary goal is to empower the developer and streamline their workflow, not to add friction.



## Additional Constraints

- All code MUST be compatible with Linux/macOS and support WSL2 on Windows.
- Only open-source dependencies with OSI-approved licenses are permitted unless explicitly justified and approved.
- All persistent data MUST be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- Security reviews are required for all external integrations.


## Development Workflow

- All changes require code review by at least one other team member.
- CI/CD pipelines MUST run all tests and linters before merge.
- No direct commits to main; all changes via pull request.
- Feature branches MUST be named after the spec/feature (e.g., `001-photo-albums`).
- All specs, plans, and tasks MUST be kept in sync with the constitution.


## Governance

- This constitution supersedes all other development practices in the project.
- Amendments require a documented proposal, team review, and explicit version bump.
- All PRs and reviews MUST verify compliance with the constitution and document any exceptions.
- Versioning follows semantic rules: MAJOR for breaking/removal, MINOR for new principles/sections, PATCH for clarifications.
- Compliance reviews are required quarterly or after any MAJOR/MINOR version bump.
