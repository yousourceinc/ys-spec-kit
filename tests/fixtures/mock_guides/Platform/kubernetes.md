# Kubernetes Deployment Standards

## Application Deployment

### Container Images
- Use minimal base images (Alpine, Distroless)
- Multi-stage builds for optimization
- Security scanning and vulnerability checks
- Image tagging and versioning strategies

### Pod Specifications
- Resource requests and limits
- Health checks (readiness, liveness, startup)
- Security contexts and capabilities
- Service accounts and RBAC

### Deployment Strategies
- Rolling updates for zero-downtime deployments
- Blue-green deployments for complex applications
- Canary deployments for gradual rollouts
- Rollback procedures and strategies

## Service Management

### Service Types
- ClusterIP for internal communication
- LoadBalancer for external access
- NodePort for development environments
- Ingress for HTTP/HTTPS routing

### Networking
- Network policies for traffic control
- Service mesh integration (Istio, Linkerd)
- DNS configuration and service discovery
- Load balancing algorithms

## Configuration Management

### ConfigMaps and Secrets
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secret rotation and management
- Configuration validation
- Application configuration patterns

### Environment Variables
- Configuration injection patterns
- Environment variable precedence
- Configuration templating
- Runtime configuration updates

## Observability

### Logging
- Structured logging formats
- Log aggregation (EFK stack)
- Log retention policies
- Log analysis and correlation

### Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics collection
- Custom application metrics
- Alerting rules and thresholds
- Dashboard creation (Grafana)

### Tracing
- Distributed tracing setup
- Trace sampling strategies
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Error tracking and debugging

## Security

### Pod Security
- Security contexts and policies
- Network policies enforcement
- Image security scanning
- Runtime security monitoring

### Access Control
- RBAC configuration
- Service account management
- Pod security standards
- Admission controllers

## Best Practices

- Use Helm for complex applications
- Implement GitOps workflows
- Automate testing and validation
- Document deployment procedures
- Plan for disaster recovery
