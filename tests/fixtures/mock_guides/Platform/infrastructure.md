# Infrastructure as Code Standards

## Infrastructure Components

### Compute Resources
- Virtual machines and containers
- Auto-scaling groups
- Load balancers and networking
- Storage solutions (object, block, file)

### Configuration Management
- Declarative infrastructure definitions
- Version control for infrastructure code
- Environment-specific configurations
- Secret management

### Monitoring and Observability
- Application performance monitoring
- Infrastructure metrics collection
- Log aggregation and analysis
- Alerting and incident response

## IaC Best Practices

### Code Organization
- Modular infrastructure components
- Environment separation (dev/staging/prod)
- Reusable modules and templates
- Clear naming conventions

### Version Control
- Infrastructure code in Git
- Pull request reviews for changes
- Automated testing of infrastructure code
- Rollback procedures

### Security
- Least privilege access
- Encryption of sensitive data
- Network segmentation
- Regular security updates

## Tools and Technologies

### Cloud Platforms
- AWS, Azure, GCP infrastructure services
- Multi-cloud deployment strategies
- Cloud-native architecture patterns

### IaC Tools
- Terraform for declarative infrastructure
- AWS CloudFormation
- Ansible for configuration management
- Kubernetes manifests

### CI/CD Integration
- Automated infrastructure deployment
- Blue-green and canary deployments
- Infrastructure testing
- Compliance as code
