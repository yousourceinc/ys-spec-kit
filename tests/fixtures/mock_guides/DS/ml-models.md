# Machine Learning Model Standards

## Model Development Lifecycle

### Problem Definition
- Clearly define the business problem
- Identify success metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, etc.)
- Determine data requirements
- Establish baseline performance

### Data Preparation
- Data collection and integration
- Exploratory data analysis
- Feature engineering and selection
- Data splitting (train/validation/test)

### Model Training
- Algorithm selection based on problem type
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation
- Model evaluation and comparison

### Model Deployment
- Model serialization and versioning
- API development for model serving
- Performance monitoring
- A/B testing and gradual rollout

## Model Evaluation

### Classification Metrics
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC and PR-AUC curves
- Confusion matrix analysis
- Class imbalance handling

### Regression Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
- R-squared and Adjusted R-squared

### Best Practices
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics for your problem
- Implement cross-validation properly
- Avoid data leakage
- Test models on unseen data
- Document model limitations

## Model Interpretability

### Feature Importance
- Analyze feature contributions
- Use SHAP values for explanation
- Implement partial dependence plots
- Document important features

### Model Documentation
- Describe model architecture
- Document training data and preprocessing
- Explain model limitations
- Provide usage examples

## Ethical Considerations

- Bias detection and mitigation
- Fairness metrics implementation
- Privacy-preserving techniques
- Responsible AI practices
