```yaml
rules:
  - id: "PYTHON-001"
    type: "file_exists"
    path: "src/main.py"
    division: "SE"  # Software Engineering only
```

**Status**: Planned - Not Started

**Goal**: Evaluate rules in parallel for faster checks

**Features**:
- Multi-threaded rule evaluation
- Async waiver matching
- Concurrent guide parsing

**Status**: Planned - Not Started

### Phase 10: Web Dashboard (Q1 2026)

**Goal**: Visual compliance dashboard

**Features**:
- Real-time compliance metrics
- Historical trend charts
- Waiver analytics
- Team collaboration

**Status**: Planned - Not Started

### Phase 11: CI/CD Integration (Q2 2026)

**Goal**: Automated compliance in pipelines

**Features**:
- GitHub Actions workflow
- GitLab CI integration
- Jenkins plugin
- Slack notifications

**Status**: Planned - Not Started

## Recent Decisions

### Decision: Documentation Reorganization (2025-10-22)

**Context**: Root directory had 20+ markdown files creating clutter

**Decision**: Reorganize documentation into clear categories

```
/docs/guides/         - Governance and feature guides
/project-meta/        - Release history and completion logs
/.archive/            - Historical one-off documents
```

**Impact**: Improved discoverability, professional structure

**Related Files**:
- [docs/guides/governance-overview.md](../../docs/guides/governance-overview.md)
- [docs/guides/governance-quickstart.md](../../docs/guides/governance-quickstart.md)
- [project-meta/completion-logs/](../completion-logs/)
- [project-meta/releases/](../releases/)

## Key Metrics

### Development Velocity

- **Phases Completed**: 7/7
- **Features Implemented**: 15+
- **Test Coverage**: 210 tests
- **Code Quality**: 100% pass rate
- **Performance Improvement**: 50-100x with caching

### Timeline

```
2025-10-20: Phases 1-4 Complete (Governance Core)
2025-10-21: Phase 5-6 Complete (Audit Trail & Rule Authoring)
2025-10-21: Phase 7 Complete (Polish & Documentation)
2025-10-21: v0.4.1 Released
2025-10-22: Documentation Reorganized
```

## Next Actions

- [x] Verify all 210 tests passing
- [x] Create comprehensive documentation
- [x] Reorganize documentation structure
- [ ] Prepare v0.4.1 for release

### Short Term (Next Week)

- [ ] Release v0.4.1 to npm
- [ ] Gather team feedback
- [ ] Plan Phase 8 (division-aware compliance)
- [ ] Start Phase 8 design document

### Medium Term (Next Month)

- [ ] Implement Phase 8 features
- [ ] Begin Phase 9 architecture design

- [ ] Prepare v0.4.2 release

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|-----------|
| Performance degradation with large codebases | Low | Medium | Caching system in place, monitoring |
| Cache invalidation issues | Low | High | MD5 validation, auto-expiry, testing |
| Waiver sprawl (too many exceptions) | Medium | Medium | Audit trail, team review process |
| Rule maintenance burden | Medium | Low | Clear templates, validation helpers |

## Known Limitations

1. **Division-Aware Filtering**: Not yet implemented (Phase 8)
2. **Parallel Evaluation**: Sequential evaluation only (Phase 9)
3. **CI/CD Integration**: Not yet implemented (Phase 11)
4. **Web Dashboard**: Not yet implemented (Phase 10)

## Success Criteria Met

✅ Waiver recording (<10 seconds)  
✅ Compliance checking (<30 seconds)  
✅ Rule validation with helpful errors  
✅ Audit trail with timestamps  
✅ Version control integration  
✅ Performance with caching  
✅ Comprehensive documentation
