## [0.3.0] - 2025-10-16

### Added

- **GitHub OAuth authentication**: Browser-based and device flow OAuth for team access control
- **Organization membership verification**: Automatic verification that users are members of authorized GitHub organization
- **npm distribution**: Package now available via npm/npx for easier team distribution
- **Node.js wrapper**: JavaScript wrapper around Python CLI that handles OAuth authentication
- **Logout command**: New `specify logout` command to clear OAuth authentication
- **Secure token storage**: OAuth tokens stored securely in `~/.specify/oauth_token.json` with restrictive file permissions (600)
- **Dual authentication flows**: 
  - Browser flow (default) - automatic browser-based OAuth for GUI environments
  - Device flow - manual code entry for SSH/headless environments
- **Environment detection**: Automatically selects appropriate OAuth flow based on environment

### Changed

- **Authentication method**: OAuth flow instead of manual token creation for better security and UX
- **Distribution method**: Now available via npm in addition to pip
- **Version**: Bumped to 0.3.0 per AGENTS.md requirements for changes to `__init__.py`

### Security

- OAuth tokens have minimal permissions (read:org, read:user only)
- CSRF protection via state parameter in OAuth flow
- Local callback server for OAuth (localhost only, port 8888)
- Token files created with restrictive permissions (600)
- No token data sent to external servers (stays on user's machine)

## [LATEST_VERSION] - RELEASE_DATE

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `specify init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
	- Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- `--force` flag for `init` command to bypass confirmation when using `--here` in a non-empty directory and proceed with merging/overwriting files.

### Added

- Support for Roo Code.

## [0.0.14] - 2025-09-21

- Agent folder security notice displayed after project provisioning completion, warning users that some agents may store credentials or auth tokens in their agent folders and recommending adding relevant folders to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

### Changed

- Cleaned up the `check` command output.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-09-21
